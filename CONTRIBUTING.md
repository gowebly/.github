# Contributing to `gowebly`

_TL;DR: sign up for notifications of GitHub Issues and Discussions in main 
repositories, be [courteous](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), follow the steps below to 
set up a development environment; if you stick around and contribute, you 
can join the team (write about yourself to us at 
[koddr.me@gmail.com][vic_shostak_email]) and get commit access._

## Welcome

We invite you to join our team! Everyone is welcome to contribute code
via pull requests, to help people asking for help on issues, or in GitHub
Discussions, to help triage, reproduce, or fix bugs that people have
filed, to add to our documentation, or to help out in any other way.

We grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue
database, such as being able to edit labels) to people who have gained
our trust and demonstrated a commitment to `gowebly` project.

We communicate primarily over GitHub and email 
([koddr.me@gmail.com][vic_shostak_email]).

_See also: the [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of the project._

## Helping out in the issue database

If you want to help us triage, you are very welcome to do so!

1. Sign up for notifications of new Issues and Discussions in this
   organization's main public repositories: [gowebly][gowebly_url] and
   [gowebly helpers][gowebly_helpers_url].
2. Read [our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates
   explicitly that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional.
   If you're helping out with triage, you are representing the `gowebly` 
   project team, and so you want to make sure to make a good impression!
3. Once you've been doing this for a while, someone will invite you to
   the `gowebly-contributors` team on GitHub, and you'll be able to
   add labels too.

## Developing for `gowebly`

To develop for the `gowebly` project, you will eventually need to become
familiar with our processes and conventions. This section lists the
documents that describe these methodologies. The following list is ordered:
you are strongly recommended to go through these documents in the order
presented.

1. [Our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly
   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. This
   also documents our conflict resolution policy and encourages people
   to ask questions.
2. Strict following all community and developer-accepted style guides for
   the technologies and frameworks used in all `gowebly` projects.
   Technologies: [Go][go_url], [Docker][docker_url], [htmx][htmx_url],
   [hyperscript][hyperscript_url]; Go frameworks: [Fiber][fiber_url], 
   [Echo][echo_url], [chi][chi_url]; CSS frameworks:
   [Tailwind CSS][tailwindcss_url], [UnoCSS][unocss_url].
3. Communication is in English (US). If this is not your native language,
   please use translators and text helpers when writing text (comments in
   code, PR descriptions, answers in Issues or Discussions, and so on).
   We ourselves use [LanguageTool][languagetool_url], [DeepL][deepl_url] and
   [Code Spell Checker][code_spell_checker_url] for VS Code and
   [Grazie lite][grazie_lite_url] for JetBrains IDEs.
